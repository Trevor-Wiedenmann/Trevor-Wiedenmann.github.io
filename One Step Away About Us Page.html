      <p>A One Step Away's goal is to bring you back to when people would settle in Idaho to find a very elusive element; gold. Back then, people had to find gold by panning for it. A One Step Away allows you to recreate their attempts to find gold by providing its own panning for gold session. In addition, our lodge comes with many accomodations, such as a bed and breakfast, a shopping village, and many different suites.</p>
